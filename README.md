# LoadingBoxesWithGeneticAlgorithm
The three-dimensional cargo loading problem is a practical problem faced in modern industrial processes such as container ship loading, pallet loading, plane cargo management, and warehouse management. This article considers a three-dimensional cargo loading problem
in which objects of various volumes are packed into a single cargo truck to maximize the number of objects packed. The cargo loading problem initially appears fairly simple; however, scholars have found its behavior rather complex. The formulated packing strategy seeks to minimize the number of cuboid spaces generated during the packing process by matching the objectâ€™s height, length, or width with the dimensions of the packing space. A hybrid genetic algorithm was used to solve the three-dimensional cargo loading problem with this packing
strategy. To fully implement this project we started by making a small scale 2-dimensional loading problem. After this point we implemented the 3rd dimension to our problem, Which introduced the volume of boxes.

We used processing 3 for the visualization of our 3D container. download and run the codes in 'processing 3'
